@title CVR (content validity ratio)
@description Calculate the CVR coefficient (content validity ratio)
@param data dataframe, with the columns assigned to each judge, and the rows assigned to each evaluated item.

@return
dataframe with CVR coefficients for all analyzed items

@details
The CVR function calculates the content validity ratio (CVR; Lashe, 1975). CVR function that the items were rated in three categories: Not important (1), useful but not essential (2), essential (3). CVR dichotomizes each rating, and yields the proportion of judges who considered the item essential.
Under this model, the usual cut-off point for identifying essential items in the CVR should be located at the highest possible rating, i.e., on a scale of 1 to 3, the cut-off point is 3.

Note: The function has not yet been prepared to resolve missing values, so the user must remove or impute any missing values.
