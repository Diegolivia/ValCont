@title CVI_R: Content Validity Index, Revised
@description Calculate the CVI coefficient with chance agreement adjustment (Polit & Beck, 2007).
@param data dataframe, with the columns assigned to each judge, and the rows assigned to each evaluated item.
@param cut Specific cut-off point in the response rating, from which the item is considered valid (or relevant, clear, etc.).
@param conf.level confidence level for asymmetric confidence intervals (ex., .90, .95, .99)

@return 
dataframe with CVI_R coefficients for all items analyzed, and confidence intervals.

@details 
The 'CVIR' function calculates the CVI, with adjustment for chance agreement (Polit, Beck, & Owen, 2007).
As with the 'CVI' function, in 'CVIR' items can be rated with a wide range of point scales (Polit, Beck,
& Owen, 2007; Polit, & Beck, 2006). This rating scale can be 3-point, or usually 4- or 5-point (Lynn, 
1986; Waltz & Bausell, 1981). 
The 'CVIR' cutoff point, for identifying valid items, is generally based on the last two top ratings; 
for example, on a relevance scale of 1 to 4, the cutoff point may be 3 (Beck & Gable, 2001; Grant & 
Davis, 1997). 'CVI_R' uses 'cut' to dichotomize the judges' responses and transform them into the CVI.
The asymmetric confidence intervals use Wilson's (1927) approach, as applied to Aiken's V coefficient
(Penfield, & Giacobbi, 2004). The results should be complemented by an estimator of inter-judge
variability or agreement.

Note: The function has not yet been prepared to resolve missing values, so the user must remove or impute any missing values.
