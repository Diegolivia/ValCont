@title Critical value for CVR, based on Baghestani et al., (2019)
@description Calculates critical values for Lawshe’s content validity ratio (CVR) using the Bayesian method 
proposed by Baghestani et al. (2019), based on Beta priors and posterior probabilities.
@param num_jueces Number of judges who provided their ratings (must be >= 2).
@param prior Type of prior distribution: "Jeffreys" (default) or "Uniform".
@param alpha Significance level for the critical value calculation (default: 0.05).
@param tails Distribution tails: "one" for one-tailed test (default) or "two" for two-tailed test.

@return 
A data frame with numeric results and six columns: 
- "Method": The method used (Baghestani).
- "Prior": The type of prior used ("Jeffreys" or "Uniform").
- "Alpha": The chosen significance level.
- "Tails": The type of test ("one" or "two").
- "CritVal": The calculated critical value for CVR.
- "MinJudges": The minimum number of judges needed for the critical CVR.

@details
Lawshe's content validity ratio (CVR; ) requires critical values for interpretation, based on the 
alpha level chosen (0.05 or 0.01) and the number of judges. `CVRcut.Bag` estimates this critical
value based on the Bayesian statistic (Baghestani et al., 2017). This approach can maximize the 
accuracy of the critical values for CVR, due to the usual small sample size to obtain evidence 
of content validity. This method requires key information about the possible prior distribution. 
Baghestani et al., (2017) uses noninformative priors for CVR, based on: a) Jeffrey (1935), 
Beta(1/2, 1/2); or b) Berger (2013)'s uniform, Beta(1,1).

### Examples ----------

# N judges = 45, uniform prior, alpha = .05, one-tailed test
CVRcut.Bag(num_jueces = 45, prior = "Uniform", alpha = .05, tails = "one")


# N judges = 45, Jeffreys prior, alpha = .05, one-tailed test
CVRcut.Bag(num_jueces = 45, prior = "Jeffreys", alpha = .05, tails = "one")

# N judges = 45, Jeffreys prior, alpha = .01, two-tailed test
CVRcut.Bag(num_jueces = 45, prior = "Jeffreys", alpha = .01, tails = "two")
