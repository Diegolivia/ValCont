@title HAiken (H coefficient)
@description Calculate the coefficient of homogeneity of response for each item (Aiken, 1980, 1985).

@param data dataframe, with the columns assigned to each judge, and the rows assigned to each evaluated item.
@param ncat number of response categories or options used in the rating
@param conf.level confidence level for the confidence intervals (eg., .90, .95, .99)

@return 
dataframe with H coefficients for all items analyzed, and their confidence intervals.

@details
Compute the H coefficient (Aiken, 1980, 1985) to estimate the homogeneity of response of the judges/scorers to the items. 
To maintain consistency with the methods usually associated with content validity, 'HAiken' is proposed as an option.
'HAiken' also compute asymmetric confidence intervals use the method of Wilson (1927). and adapted by Penfield and Giacobbi (2004) for Aiken's V coefficient. 
The H coefficient, or equivalent coefficients, should complement the results of the content validity coefficients. 
Other methods for estimating judges' agreement or homogeneity of response may also be useful. Note: The function has not yet been prepared to resolve missing values, so the user must remove or impute any missing values.

@examples
### Example 1

#Load data
Ej2 <- data.frame(
  j1 = c(4, 1, 1, 1, 4),
  j2 = c(4, 1, 2, 2, 3),
  j3 = c(4, 1, 3, 3, 5),
  j4 = c(4, 1, 4, 5, 5),
  j5 = c(4, 1, 5, 5, 5),
  j6 = c(4, 1, 3, 5, 5)
)

# Run HAiken
HAiken(Ej2, 
       ncat = 5, 
       alpha = .90)

### Example 2
# In a dataframe where the rows are the items and the columns are the raters, H can be calculated for the raters (columns) by simply transposing the data and entering it as a data frame.

Haiken(as.data.frame(t(Ej2)), 
       ncat = 5, 
       alpha = .90)
