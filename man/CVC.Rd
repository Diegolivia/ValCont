\usage{
CVC(data, max, conf.level)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe, with n columns (judges or scorers), and k rows (evaluated items).}

\item{max}{maximum possible rating value used.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level for confidence intervals (eg., .90, .95, .99).}
}
\value{
dataframe with CVC coefficients and confidence intervals.
}
\description{
Calculates the content validity coefficient (CVC; Hernandez-Nieto, 2002). CVC makes an adjustment for random response.
}
\details{
This function calculates the content validity coefficient CVC (Hernandez-Nieto, 2002). Asymmetric confidence intervals are also calculated (Wilson, 1927; Penfield & Giacobbi, 2004). CVC' is the second coefficient that adjusts for possible random response of the raters, while another proposal for the CVI coefficient was created by Polit, & Beck (2007).

Note: The function has not yet been prepared to resolve missing values, so the user must remove or impute any missing values.

\examples{
### Example 1
### Fictitious data Ej1: 15 judges, and 15 items evaluated by the judges

Ej1 <- data.frame(
 J1 = c(5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 3, 4, 4),
 J2 = c(5, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 4, 6, 5, 6, 4, 4, 3),
 J3 = c(5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 5, 4, 5, 5, 6, 5, 3, 5),
 J4 = c(5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 3, 6, 5, 3, 5),
 J5 = c(5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 6, 3, 4, 5),
 J6 = c(5, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 3, 6, 4, 4, 4),
 J7 = c(2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 5, 6, 5, 3, 6),
 J8 = c(5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 3, 5),
 J9 = c(4, 5, 5, 6, 5, 4, 6, 5, 5, 6, 4, 6, 5, 4, 4),
 J10 = c(4, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 3),
 J11 = c(5, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 4, 4),
 J12 = c(5, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 4, 4),
 J13 = c(2, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 4, 2, 4, 6, 3, 3, 4),
 J14 = c(5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 4, 5),
 J15 = c(5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 3, 4))

## Run CVC.
CVC(Ej1,max = 6, conf.level = .90)

### Example 2
### Random data
## Aritificial data
random_data <- data.frame(replicate(n = 6,sample(1:5,12,rep=TRUE)))

## Run CVC
CVC(random_data,max = 5, conf.level = .90)
