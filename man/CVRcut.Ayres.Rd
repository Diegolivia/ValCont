\title{Critical value for CVR, based on Ayres & Scally (2014)}
\usage{
CVRcut.Ayres(num_jueces, alpha = 0.05, tails = "one")
}
\arguments{
\item{num_jueces}{Number of judges who provided their ratings (must be >= 2).}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for the critical value calculation (default: 0.05).}

\item{tails}{Distribution tails: "one" for one-tailed test (default) or "two" for two-tailed test.}
}
\value{
A data frame with numeric results and four columns:
- "Method": The method used (Ayres & Scally).
- "Alpha": The chosen significance level.
- "Tails": The type of test ("one" or "two").
- "CritVal": The calculated critical value for CVR.
- "MinJudges": The minimum number of judges needed for the critical CVR.

\description{
Calculates critical values for Lawshe’s content validity ratio (CVR) using the method
proposed by Ayres & Scally (2014), based on exact binomial probabilities.
}
\details{
Content validity ratio (CVR; Lawshe, 1975) requires critical values for interpretation,
based on the alpha level chosen (0.05 or 0.01) and the number of judges. `CVRcut.Ayres`
estimates this critical value based on the Exact Binomial Probabilities method, an approach
apparently appropriate for small samples, as is usual in content validity studies,
and for proportions approaching 0 or 1. The function allows for both one-tailed and two-tailed
tests.

\examples{

### Example 1 ----------
# N judges = 10, alpha = .05
# Expected output:
CVRcut.Ayres(num_jueces = 10, alpha = .05)

### Example 2 ----------
# N judges = 45, alpha = .05
# (Expected output: Critical value and minimum number of judges for CVR, in alpha .05.)
CVRcut.Ayres(num_jueces = 45, alpha = .05)

### Example 3 ----------
# N judges = 45, alpha = .01
# (Expected output: Lower alpha (.01), higher critical values.)
CVRcut.Ayres(num_jueces = 45, alpha = .01)
