\title{Critical value for CVR, based on Wilson et al. (2012)}
\usage{
CVRcut.Wilson(num_jueces, alpha = 0.05, tails = "one")
}
\arguments{
\item{num_jueces}{Number of judges who provided their ratings (must be >= 2).}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for the critical value calculation (default: 0.05).}

\item{tails}{Distribution tails: "one" for one-tailed test (default) or "two" for
two-tailed test.}
}
\value{
A data frame with numeric results and the following columns:
- "Method": The method used ("Wilson et al. (2012)").
- "Alpha": The chosen significance level.
- "Tails": The type of test ("one" or "two").
- "CritVal": The calculated critical value for CVR (rounded to 3 decimals).
- "MinJudges": The minimum number of judges needed for the critical CVR.

\description{
Calculates critical values for Lawshe's content validity ratio (CVR) based
on the method proposed by Wilson et al. (2012).
}
\details{
The content validity ratio (CVR; Lawshe, 1975) requires critical values for interpretation,
based on the alpha level chosen (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01) and the number of judges (N).
`CVRcut.Wilson` calculates the critical values using a normal approximation to the binomial
distribution, as recalculated by Wilson et al. (2012).

CVRcut.Wilson(num_jueces = 45, alpha = .05, tails = "one")
