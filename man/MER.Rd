\title{Mean of expert ratings (MER)}
\usage{
MER(data, ncat, start, conf.level = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe, with the columns assigned to each judge, and the rows assigned to each evaluated item.}

\item{ncat}{Number of possible values or categories used in rating}

\item{start}{Minimum possible value (0 or 1)}

\item{conf.level}{Confidence level for confidence intervals (ex., .90, .95, .99)}
}
\value{
dataframe with MERs for all items analyzed, and confidence intervals.
}
\description{
Calculate the average score, with asymmetric confidence intervals.
}
\details{
Calculate the average rating of the judges for each item, based on the proposal of Penfield & Miller (2004), and asymmetric confidence intervals (Wilson, 1927; Penfield, 2003; Penfield & Miller, 2004). MER' is a modification of the two syntax previous (Merino-Soto and Livia-Segovia, 2022; Penfield, & Miller, 2004).
Due to the usual small number of participants in content validity studies, asymmetric confidence intervals may be an optimal approach to inferentially assess item validity.
The results should be supplemented with an estimator of inter-judge variability or agreement.
Note: The function has not yet been prepared to resolve missing values, so the user must remove or impute any missing values.
