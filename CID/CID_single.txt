@details
Merino-Soto (2018) used the MOVER approach as a generic method (Zou & Donner, 2008), to compare Aiken V coefficients. This function compares the results of two specific content validity coefficients with their respective confidence intervals. For example, the user can compare the coefficient calculated on his data (however, this coefficient must also have its confidence intervals calculated), with another coefficient obtained from a previous study.
The compared content validity coefficients obtained should be of the same type, and the estimated confidence intervals for these coefficients should also come from the same level; for example, at .95 or .90.
Singer (2010) observed that at extremely low values (e.g., proportions near .0), the coverage of this method is not as good. In the context of comparing content validity coefficients, treated as proportions, it is rare to find such low coefficients (and their confidence intervals). Unless the items are extremely poor in content.
