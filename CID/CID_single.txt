@title CID_single (Confidence interval for difference: single item)
@description Calculate confidence intervals for the difference of specific content validity coefficients on a single item, based on Method of Variance Estimates Recovery (MOVER).
@param coef1 numerical value obtained for coefficient 1
@param coef2 numerical value obtained for coefficient 2
@param lci1 Lower limit for coefficient 1
@param uci1 Upper limit for coefficient 1
@param lci2 Lower limit for coefficient 2
@param uci2 Upper limit for coefficient 2


@return 
dataframe with Confidence intervals for the difference of the analyzed item, and confidence intervals.

@details
Merino-Soto (2018) used the MOVER approach as a generic method (Zou & Donner, 2008), to compare Aiken V coefficients. Later, Merino-Soto (2023) extended this approach for AIken's V by adding a point estimator of the difference, based on the standardized difference between proportions
However'CID_single' function compares the results of two specific content validity coefficients with their respective confidence intervals. For example, the user can compare the coefficient calculated on his data (however, this coefficient must also have its confidence intervals calculated), with another coefficient obtained from a previous study.
The compared content validity coefficients obtained should be of the same type, and the estimated confidence intervals for these coefficients should also come from the same level; for example, at .95 or .90.
Singer (2010) observed that at extremely low values (e.g., proportions near .0), the coverage of this method is not as good. In the context of comparing content validity coefficients, treated as proportions, it is rare to find such low coefficients (and their confidence intervals). However, unless the items have been constructed extremely poorly in content, it is unlikely to obtain content validity coefficients close to zero.
